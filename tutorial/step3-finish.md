## Tutorial step 3: Start finished setup
Now, everything should be in place.
Start nginx again:
```
start nginx -p ./ -c ./nginx/nginx.conf
```

Go to `http://localhost:9080` in your browser. Click on one of the listed places, and you will get a forecast for that place.

## What now?
Very good! The tutorial is over. However, if you want to experiment a bit, you can add places and parameters to the tutorial web page, by extending the existing code!
