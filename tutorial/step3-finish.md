## Tutorial step 3: Start finished setup
Now, everything should be in place.
Open your shell again, and go to `C:\Prog\nginx-<version>`

Start nginx again:
```
nginx -p .\ -c nginx\nginx.conf
```

Go to `http://localhost:9080` in your browser. Click on one of the listed places, and you will get a forecast for that place.

You should see something like [this](../Screenshot_finished_setup.png)
## What now?
Very good! The tutorial is over. However, if you want to experiment a bit, you can add places and parameters to the tutorial web page, by extending the existing code!
